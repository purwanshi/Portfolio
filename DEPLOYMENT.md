## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Git-based Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push to Git Repository**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Netlify deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Choose your repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect settings from `netlify.toml`

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Build locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload to Netlify**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder
   - Site will be deployed instantly

## ⚙️ Build Settings (Auto-detected)

- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `dist`
- **Node version**: 18

## 🔧 Configuration Files

- `netlify.toml` - Main deployment configuration
- `public/_redirects` - SPA routing rules
- `vite.config.ts` - Build optimization
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify TypeScript compilation

### 404 Errors on Routes
- Ensure `_redirects` file is in `public/` folder
- Check `netlify.toml` redirects configuration

### Assets Not Loading
- Verify `vite.config.ts` base path is set to `/`
- Check that all assets are in the correct locations

## 📞 Support
